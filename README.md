# SinonCOExample

This gives an example of using Sinon to stub the function of an object and spy on it's call when the call is made within a generator passed to CO.

*done must be used in the test
*CO will return a promise. This promise should be returned by the function under test
*standard mocha promise testing can be used to check expected results...expects/assertions within then
